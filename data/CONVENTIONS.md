When editing code, adhere to these principles:

- Keep the SEARCH block as small as possible. Break up changes into multiple SEARCH REPLACE to keep them small.
- Stop and ask questions if anything is ambiguous.
- Follow any convetions and style present in the existing code in the code you write and change.
- Do not over explain the changes. Comments in the code you write should be rare.
- Do not over explain to the user what has been changed and why, only explain changes if it is extremely necessary.
